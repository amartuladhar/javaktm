Example0002(already posted in https://javaktm.blogspot.com)
========
Using Point - (It is to store x and y coordinates of a point)
This is example of a basic java program which shows structure of the program. It is basic java program showing different type of Java variables.
Primitive types: Integer, float, double, Boolean are shown
Creating an object.
Reference types and methods to that object.
How to print output in a screen is shown using System Class
This example is same as Example1 but with added Class Point


package com.swprogramdeveloper;

import java.awt.*;
import java.util.Date;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // write your code here
        //variable types double and integer
        double age = 30;
        int herage = (int) age + 20;
        //Printing output using System Class
        System.out.println("Hello World "+age + "---" + herage);

        //float type. Note the F- it is required as the compiler will take double as default and will show error if 'F' not given
        float viewCount= 567.23F;
        System.out.println("Float variable : " + viewCount);

        //We create a new object of Class Date using keyword 'new'
        //Object is an instance of a Class
        Date newDate1 = new Date();
        //Class will have methods, which all objects can use as per the purpose of the method
        //Date is Reference type variable and required toString method to get string to be able to print content
        System.out.println("Current Time : " + newDate1.toString());
        System.out.println("Current Time Directly : " + newDate1);

        //String is also of type Reference, but no need to create object by 'new' keyword, we can directly initialize
        String message1 = new String();
        message1 = "Hello BRO!";
        System.out.println("String : " + message1);
        //We can use many available methods of a Class
        Boolean result1 = message1.endsWith("O!");
        System.out.println("Does it contain a string ? " + result1);
        int result2 = message1.length();
        System.out.println("Length of string : \"" + message1 + "\" is :" + result2);
        System.out.println("All sent to upper case for string : \"" + message1 +"\" is : " + message1.toUpperCase() );

        //Pointers - reference type variable - with two variable x and y coordinate
        Point point1 = new Point();
        Point point2 = new Point();
        point2=point1;
		//Initializing Data
		//Since both points to same location, initializing of any one will be reflected in both points.
        point1.x=29;
        point2.y=85;
        //Both point1 and point2 are pointing to same data. 
        System.out.println("Point1 = " + point1);
        System.out.println("Point2 = " + point2);

    }
}
